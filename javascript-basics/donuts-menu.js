 */

// This is an array of objects. 
const donuts = [
    { type: "Jelly", cost: 1.22 },
    { type: "Chocolate", cost: 2.45 },
    { type: "Cider", cost: 1.59 },
    { type: "Boston Cream", cost: 5.99 }
];

// your code goes here

// Using forEach with a function arguement
// element represents a single donut which is an object 
// so we can refer to its properties using dot notation 
donuts.forEach(function(element) {

    console.log(`${element.type} donuts cost $${element.cost} each`);
